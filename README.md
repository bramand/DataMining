# This is only for test purpose

**Test with hyperlink** [my Github](https://github.com/bramand/DataMining), you can try to open it

**Test with ordered list**
Fruit:
 1. Apple
 2. Banana
 3. Orange
 4. Watermelon
 5. etc

**Test with unordered list**
Animals:

 - Bird

**Test with some text**
bold text: **this file is in bold**
italic text: *this file is in italic*
bold-italic text: ***this file is in bold and italic***

**Test with equation**
The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
